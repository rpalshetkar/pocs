I am Ratnadeep Palshetkar AKA Pally. I am part of FICC Macro Technology, supporting macro lines of businesses such as
Rates, Financing, FX, LCT, and Commodities. The team streamlines the technology offerings for FICC Macro domains like eTrading, Risk/PL/Pricing and enterprise reporting

Over the past eight years in my role, the Macro organization has undergone
significant transformation. We have focused on consolidation, breaking LOB and regional silos
and building strong horizontal foundations. We have played huge role where business ROI and efficiencies have improved where we are delivering technology better, simpler and cheaper. 

We are close to 90 people strong across six countries, supporting business revenue of close to ~1B across 12 countries. 

I was born in a lovely village nestled midway between Mumbai and Goa. I couldn't
escape my parents at home and they followed me every day to the school as my primary school teachers 
where I was under their constant watch.

Electricity was novelty at my place during those times. Lantern-Light Dinner/homework was daily ritual till | moved to Mumbai for senior school and
I did my graduation from IT Mumbai.

LEARNT - "Follow the light. Appreciate it more when you have experienced the dark"

My career choice could have been different...I had won best actor in dramatics competition
during last year of my graduation in IIT and suddenly had this itch 
to pursue career in acting; One of my critical close friend made me aware of the Tom Cruise looks 
and Amitabh Bacchan acting to get to the top.

LEARNT - "Be self-assure and realistic. Always have good advisors/open critics with you though you can be your best critic"

My 25 years of career have been quite diverse in terms of location and the firms I have worked for. 

I started my career at Citigroup's offshore development
center in Mumbai, then moved to Citibank Tokyo to support their Fixed
Income/Equity Derivatives desk. I loved being jack of everything, did every job
possible like Unix SA/DBA/developer/BA/PM/MAPS. Had truncated entire production database two times accidently (those days, no change MRA restrictions and
releaes were every day if not every few hours), wasn't found and I had all nighter; and morning was peaceful back to BAU. 
Those days 'Issue was not an issue till found'

LEARNT - "During early phase in your career, get more exposed to the different
areas/system problems, Just do anything which comes your way, have quick wins in your new role and zero in
on what your comfort zone would be for next few years and be the best in it. As you show that hunger
and curiocity to learn, you will break things/fail, but be the expert to recover
responsibly and make sure you don't give shocks to your bosses. Every failure is great learning"

Post Salomon it was Lehman brothers. I was going to quit within a week due to altercation 
with the head trader til| was told by my bosses that I was mainly hired to handle him 
because no one in tech handle him. Maybe my thick skin was known to them. The same trader offered me a trading job, but 6/7 screens just
overwhelmed me and I just loved solving technology problems.

LEARNT - "Have good bosses around you who you can talk to openly about anything so that you
don't take rash decisions. Understand your client challenges and their user
experience expectations and work with them"

I was in Tokyo for close to 10 years and Merrill came calling for HK opportunity to form team helping the
expansion of LCT desk which was getting established. Suraj was one of the
interviewers and too kind to ask any C/C++ questions to a Perl programmer. Or maybe I diverted him quite a bit to telling him all the stories
around how I could be jack of everything. After 3 years in ML, I moved to Singapore and had short stints within CS and JPM. 

I returned to Hong Kong when Suraj offered me an opportunity to lead LCT for Asia. 

LEARNT - "Never burn bridges in any org so that you can get rehired for that niche which
you have chosen carefully where you have established yourselves so that only
your name pops up in the bosses head. Keep these connections live even
fi you separate ways. Bosses love to work with the devil they know than god
they don't. PS: Grass is not always that greener on other side"

It has been great journey so far being in right place at the right time with right people with immense trust placed by SLT/team and the business. 
I was fortunate to have good hands on bosses to work for who you can learn from
with continuous open feeback loop and open mind with no words minced. We were
in sync around what could move the needle for the organization and it just was tied with my passions.

Thinking about it, I just kept on sailing through the comfort zone within FICC. But
I did/do like making my world better/more automated/no-code. When you have good
support structure and team who is creative, innovative and like to like being
challenged, opportunities just open up to expand that comfort zone. 

Behind what I am today I have support structure of three women back home who really leave me
alone to follow my passions which forunately don't intersect with theirs which saves
them from my unsolicited advices. 

My wife Anita loves cooking and feeding us. She makes one of the best Chicken
sandwiches, Tom Yum Spaghetti and Spicy kingfish. We know each other since 2nd
grade from school. She left her law profession once we got married and moved to
Tokyo though continues to practice those skills at home where I haven't won
single argument. Anita was taught by my mother during school days and that continues
till date. 

My elder daughter Tanvi who was born in Tokyo, loves playing piano, learning Cantonese and is our bargain
shopper. Younger daughter Vaibhavi was born in Hong Kong, is studying in her
first year of IB, is chief editor for school English magazine, runs
medics club. She recently finished her internship with SCMP (South China Morning Post). She has recently become Japanese
anime fan and is eagerly waiting for her first visit to Tokyo and Akihabara is top on her list.

Both of my daughters share the same birthday. 

I am in love with my own routines. They start with tram as I end my day in the office.
Tram is the best place to start unwinding your day. 

I actively code over the weekend and try new simple technologs on the block (I learnt Flutter Ul/GCP and now trying to get hands dirty on
GenAl). 

I read quite a bit of Medium articles and get overwhelmed searching
what is the best approach to certain problem. I do try to automate my digital life as much as possible,
like photo organization, mail handling, personal finances or my 30 min nagging
alarm hated by entire GMT management. For one of my app, I used Google cloud/AWS just for learning sake even if not required. 

Small POCs solving your personal problems are best way to learn new technologies.

If I am not doing two thing in parallel, I get anxious,but I choose my second target carefully where
unfocussed attention could work. So during the weekend when I am coding, I watch Hindi movies where you can pay attention for brief 1 min and you can guess the entire plot. 
Now I am binge-watching Curb your enthusiam.

Given need to have some personal focus, I play badminton for at least 4-5 hours every week. I tried meditation but just sitting and not doing
second thing in parallel couldn't cut it. 

I am big foody, have sweet tooth. Beyond Anita's specialities, and anything
Goan, I do miss my favourites from Japan; like Ninniku Tomato Spaghetti from
Capriciossa, Spicy Chicken place under Yurakucho JR station...Sweets just too many too count...

We enjoy our frequent family visits to Goa, get captivated by its mountains, pristine beaches & rice fields, and unique blend of cosmopolitan plus village-like identity. 
The vibrant Goan cuisine adds to the allure, makesit a perfect destination





My food tastes match my nature,

there. I am big fan of streaming services and struggle with optimizing time
given so spoiled with choices. ChatGPT is helping quite a bit where you can
send the list of your favorites and it can give good suggestions. Now serially
watching Curb your Enthusiasm. Also now onto some audiobooks when Igrant the
permission to the road for me to walk on IloveeatingI ambigfoody,havesweettooth.

Anything Goan (Goa is my hideaway. Idon't miss visiting Goa every year at any
cost); And Japan - Capriciossa Tomato Garlic Spaghetti &Spicy Chicken and

with you. Spend some time to
understand what moves the needle for them and be there with them"

Suraj decided to take the same risk with me again and I got back to HK. This has
been the longest inning ever for ne during my professional journey.

Learnt; Find good bosses to work for who fight for you. They shield your
weaknesses/stretch you to get setter/and you are learning via continuous
feedback loop. More brutal feedback even better. They market your strengths
more which eclipses those small black dots you may be working on getting better
at. And most importantly never burn bridges...Keep these connections live even
fi you separate ways. Bosses love to work with the devil they know than god
they don't. PS: Grass is not always that greener on other side.... 

















I have learned the importance of having a great support
structure, having deep understanding business roadmap and importance of planning
fo, having childlike curiocity,
hunger of being better and continuously improving what you have built, finding
your niche

It is importNot starting coding until I
understand the desired outcome. It's important to seek input from subject matter
experts and find a unique and impactful role within the organization. By
remaining open and observant, unexpected opportunities can arise.


I later joined Salomon Brothers, where we accomplished the integration of
derivatives within a few months. I also worked at Lehman Brothers before joining
Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. After three years at Merrill Lynch, I moved to
Singapore and had stints at Credit Suisse and JPMorgan.













===============================================================================

Throughout my journey, timing has played a significant role. I joined during
significant developments in global markets, such as BIB and CPRT. Asia
complexities became known globally, and Quartz investment showed tremendous
potential. My team faced challenges but also hired talented individuals at all
levels.





I am known as Pally acronymed from my long Indian name Ratnadeep Palshetkar. I am
part of FICC Macro Technology which enables macro lines of businesses(Rates,
Financing, FX, LCT and Commodities) and contribut into Risk/Ul &Trade Horizontal
foundations. My current role focusses on streamlining technology offering for
FICC Macro eTrading, Risk/PL/Pricing and front office sourcing for enterprise
downstream. We help to drive product anc business expansion for across 1
countries within Asia.

My 25 years of career have been quite diverse in terms of location and the firms
I have worked for.

Iwas born in a lovely village nestled midway between Mumbai and Goa. Icouldn't
escape my parents and they followed me every day to the school and they
continued to do that as my primary school teachers where Iwas unde their
constant watch. Electricity was novelty in India during those times.
Lantern-Light Dinner/homework was daily ritual till | moved to Mumbai for senior
school and Idid my graduation from IT Mumbai. lesson Learnt; Follow the light.
You appreciate it more when you have experienced the dark.

Through campus, I landed a job at Citigroup offshore development center in
Mumbai which took me to Citibank Tokyo to support their Fixed income/equity
derivatives desk as single person team (Daunting when your skin has not become
that thick with little experience very little experience dealing with trading
but it got easier where Icould be unix SA/DBA/developer/BA/production support
and jack of everything. 

That was the start of my career journey within Markets
FO technology. Moved to Salomon Brothers as Citibank/Travellers merged and we
had three people in the team in tech who did whole derivatives integration
within few months.... 

(Almost no regulation/production access/freedom to release
daily/or running production jobs from dev environment just did wonders and 
I was lucky Inever got caught where two three times Iwiped entire production database
and SOD was like nothing happened except me sleeping in the office post
herculean recoveries and napping next day. Those were the days where it was
issue is not an issue till it is found. 

Lesson Learnt; Know the pains of your
client well and think how they might be thinking in their head fi systems don't
work. And then know what you are doing really really well so that you can
recover quickly fi you break systems. 

 
 Suraj decided to take the same risk with me again and I got back to HK. This has

 Learnt; Find good bosses to work for who fight for you. They shield your
 weaknesses/stretch you to get setter/and you are learning via continuous
 feedback loop. More brutal feedback even better. They market your strengths
 more which eclipses those small black dots you may be working on getting better

 My Journey so far; Timing just worked out. 

 The year I joined BIB and CPRT were the biggest
 things within global markets. Asia complexities got known globally. Finally
 Quartz investment started showing tremendous potential. It tested my team, we
 were also fortunate to hire good talent across all levels. Over the course of
 last 8 years, organization has been transforming. My role also expanded where
 we now have close to 90 people across 6 countries supporting ~1B revenue across
 12 countries. We found opportunities via consolidation/breaking LOB and
 regional silos and running horizontally. 

 Thin LOB verticals but strong core
 horizontal foundation is what we are pushing for us to be
 simpler/better/cheaper. Front office engagement has never been this better. We
 defined what the team should look like and created roles, identified skills
 gaps and brought in right people into right role to make us whole complementing
 each other to deliver as team. IBOR/CPRT/CIRT/BIB/P2-GRETVenues list goes on
 but business started seeing ROl and efficiencies. Lesson Learnt: 

 Have a support
 structure you trust. Understand strategy/roadmap and whys, Understand the
 business. Be childlike curious. Don't start coding til you understand how
 business would see the end outcome of your development. Bother the SMEs til you
 know it. Re your place ni the org; Find where you would be unique, most
 valuable and impactful, where you see the gap. Find that right sweet spot. The
 organization is diverse/broad and fi you know that unique power of yours, keep
 your eyes and ears wide open and you wil see opportunities you never thought
 about. Has been great ride so far. 

 I have been trusted by global and regional
 SLT for not dropping so many balls and balancing quick as well as long terms
 wins. I have been in the right place at right time with right people with
 immense trust placed by SLT and business. 

 If not for some of those short
 term/emotional decisions along the way, I would have had my sabbatical earlier.
